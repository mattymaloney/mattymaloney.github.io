I'll try one of these next:

* [Booting/Building a Minimal Busybox based Linux distro | RevCode](https://revcode.wordpress.com/2012/02/25/booting-a-minimal-busybox-based-linux-distro/)
* [http://blog.nasirabed.com/2012/01/minimal-linux-busybox.html is not available](http://blog.nasirabed.com/2012/01/minimal-linux-busybox.html)
* [How To Build a Minimal Linux System from Source Code](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~okeefe/p2b/buildMin/buildMin.html)
* [T2 SDE](http://www.t2-project.org/about.html)

Probably this one: [Booting/Building a Minimal Busybox based Linux distro | RevCode](https://revcode.wordpress.com/2012/02/25/booting-a-minimal-busybox-based-linux-distro/)
