title: PHP Frameworks
---

Moving forward with our new content, warehouse, orders, and customer management app, I'm looking at php frameworks again. Our original app does not use any framework. The second version is unfinished, and it was using [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)).

Before getting started again, I'm looking at 2 other frameworks to consider replacing Laravel. However, in looking at Laravel's current status in the world, it's still doing fine and still actively developed. So maybe my interest in new frameworks can be ignored.

### [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/)

*"Silex is a microframework for PHP. It is built on the shoulders of Symfony2 and Pimple and also inspired by sinatra. Silex aims to be: concise, extensible, and testable."*

### [Slim Framework](http://www.slimframework.com/)

*"Slim is a PHP microframework that helps you quickly write simple yet powerful web applications and APIs."*


All three frameworks are available on github.

* [laravel/laravel: A PHP Framework For Web Artisans](https://github.com/laravel/laravel)
* [silexphp/Silex: The PHP micro-framework based on the Symfony2 Components](https://github.com/silexphp/Silex)
* [slimphp/Slim: Slim Framework source code](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim)
