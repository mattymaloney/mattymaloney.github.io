It's so rare that I have to fiddle with iptables. But right now, without a legit sysadmin around, I'm fiddling.

I think these 2 resources tell me everything I need to know.

* [IptablesHowTo - Community Help Wiki](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo)
* [Delete single iptables rules - major.io](https://major.io/2007/02/09/delete-single-iptables-rules/)
