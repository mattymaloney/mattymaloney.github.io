title: Obtaining an OS X El Capitan ISO or Bootable USB Device
---

Apple is not providing an OS X El Capitan iso image -- not even for sale, as far as I can tell. Although they do allow download of the full installer app from the App Store.

I'm using these 2 resources to understand the makeup of the downloaded installer app and to create an ISO or bootable USB from it.
