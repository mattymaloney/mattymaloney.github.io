title: Customizing the bash Prompt
---

I always want to customize the bash prompt, to add some space between commands and to colorize the prompt to more easily recognize where I am and who I am. However, since I don't do this often enough to remember how to do it, and I'm always reluctant to take the time to look it up, I mostly get by with the default bash prompts.

Now, to remedy that, I will finally take some notes on my preferred prompt configuration.

Someday, also consider the [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/).
