[Programmable SMS - Twilio Text Messaging for Mobile & Web Apps](https://www.twilio.com/sms)

Basic pricing rundown is $1/mo for the phone number and .75Â¢/message (sending or receiving) to/from US phone numbers. Twilio works with a long list of countries, and prices to other countries are more, sometimes 5x or 10x more. But still not unreasonable.
