# Initial Interview via Email for Costume Craze in Pleasant Grove

Job listing: https://www.ksl.com/jobs/listing/643071

## Introduction

Hi, this is Matt, one of the founders, and one of the 3 owners of Costume Craze.

My realm of responsibility is all technology, including all hardware, purchased software, development of proprietary software, integration, and networks. Some of that responsibility is for desktop, server, network, user, and application administration, all of which could be delegated to you.

Regarding desktops, we usually have a desktop/appliance/printer/handheld/terminal-centric help technician, but right now we do not, and we'd need your help to hire another, guiding them to success.

In summary, the job is the head of a small department -- you and one other, who answers to you, and for whom you take responsibility.

## Questions

The first questions in this interview do not need to be answered in real-time. I do not need to put you on the spot, yet, so I'm asking them via email. I hope to hear back from you at your earliest convenience. I've received several interesting candidates over the last 2 weeks, and I'm expecting to choose our new sysadmin by the end of the week.

What do you know, or what can you find out, about Costume Craze?

Given what I've told you above and what you've just learned answering the previous question, what's interesting to you about Costume Craze? Why do you want to work here?

What's your current employment status? If you're currently employed, what's your exit/transition strategy?

-Matt
