title: "Watches with Independent GPS, storage, and Bluetooth-Enabled MP3 Music Playing"
---

I really don't want to run with a phone on my arm, but I have become dependent on running with music -- and even somewhat dependent on running with GPS.

Here are 3 reasonable (under $200) watches that have built-in independent GPS and can store and play mp3 music without dependence on a phone.
