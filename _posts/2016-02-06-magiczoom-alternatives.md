Some frustration with MagicZoom today left me wondering if there's anything better out there.

I didn't find anything, but I also didn't look very hard.

The 2 I did find are not perfect. They are less perfect than MagicZoom.

* [EasyZoom, jQuery image zoom plugin](http://i-like-robots.github.io/EasyZoom/)
* [SwinxyZoom, Touch ready highly compatible jQuery image zoom plugin - SwinxyApps](http://www.swinxyapps.com/pages/apps/swinxy-zoom/index.html)
