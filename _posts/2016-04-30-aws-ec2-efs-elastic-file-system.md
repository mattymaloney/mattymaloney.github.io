title: Migrating to AWS EFS
---
Next step for integrating/moving to AWS is Elastic File System. Once I'm happy with our https server, and done testing it with the wordpress sites and moving the wordpress sites to their own instances of this server, we will test it with our primary site, this time using EFS as the content file store.

I applied for access to the beta period from our aws-test account.
