### OpenShift

I found one reasonable option for free hosting of nodejs apps.
[OpenShift by Red Hat](https://www.openshift.com/)

The free tier includes 3 "gears", which I think are application containers.

Here's a tutorial for getting a harp app running in nodejs on openshift.

They actually support other app types as well, e.g. even WordPress.


### Netlify

Yeah. This is probably a better option. Offers site rebuilds on github or bitbucket push events. I'm not sure what the free tier includes, but it definitely includes at least one static app/site.
