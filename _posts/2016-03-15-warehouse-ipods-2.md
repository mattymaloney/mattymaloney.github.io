title: 2nd Iteration of Warehouse iPods
---

Our second generation of warehouse iPods. I'm proposing and experimenting with this configuration:

* iPod Touch 4th Gen
* Linea Pro Barcode Scanner (some with MSR, 2D, 1D -- we only need the 1D scanners)
* neck strap (haven't decided on one yet)
* Linea support apps
* jailbreak to hide all except ccraze apps

Possible neckstrap is the "official" holster and shoulder/neck strap: [HOL-LP4-C-W-SHL: Infinite Peripherals Linea Pro 4 Holster with Shoulder Strap - Big Sales, Big Inventory and Same Day Shipping!](http://www.barcodegiant.com/infinite-peripherals/part-hol-lp4-c-w-shl.htm). $35 from this site, but $45 to $55 from other sites.

Consider also the Apto Pistol Grip. [Apto Pistol Grip - Stimare](https://stimare.net/products/linea-pro-scanners/linea-pro-accessories/apto-pistol-grip/). I don't have a price for this yet.
