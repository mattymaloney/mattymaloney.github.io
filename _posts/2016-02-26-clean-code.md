title: Writing Cleaner Code
---

Getting modern with coding style. What are the modern-day, best ideas for writing clean code? Especially the ideas beyond the style of the code itself -- i.e. beyond indentation, spaces, tabs, curly-bracket placement, etc. It's easy to observe the commonly overwhelming "best" practices for the simple style elements of indentation and curly-bracket placement. I'd like to look a little deeper and define some more code-style expectations. Partly to implement for current developers, but also to expect to see in developer interviews.

See the links to [Style guides for Google-originated open-source projects](https://github.com/google/styleguide) and links to 3 books on Amazon.

This google style guide appears to mostly be about code layout and visual style. That's a start, but I'm looking for more.
