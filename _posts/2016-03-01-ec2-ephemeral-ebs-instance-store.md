title: "Determining EC2 Storage Type - EBS, Ephemeral, or Instance Store"
---

I'm confused a bit about how to determine which storage types are attached to an EC2 instance, and I think I found a couple good answers to help.

[linux - Determining if ephemeral storage is attached to an instance in Amazon Web Services console? - Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/31191224/1298086)

And several answres here, some of which are at least partly true. I'd need to experiment some more before I know for sure.
