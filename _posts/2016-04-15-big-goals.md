## Cleanup/Clean-out Google Apps

Backup and retire old Google apps accounts. Should be able to find at least 20 removable accounts.


## lap-bp

Finish creating the generic, well optimized Apache/PHP server AMI at Amazon on EC2. This is called *lap-bp* for Linux Apache PHP Boilerplate.


## Move/Consolidate costumecraze.com
 
* Move img.costumecraze.com to a VPC reserved instance.

* Move liquidweb services to Amazon EC2/RDS. Simultaneously:

  * Move ccraze mysql to an RDS instance.

  * Move www.costumecraze.com to a lap-bp instance, inside the VPC shared with the new img.costumecraze.com instance.

  * Move m.costumecraze.com to another lap-bp instance on this same VPC.

  * Create a pub.costumecraze.com instance used as a preview server as well as an sftp publishing destination.
