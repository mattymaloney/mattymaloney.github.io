I ran a lot of (am still running a lot of) `bcp` commands today. I just barely thought of the notion that I should/could have scripted a sproc to run all the `bcp` commands.

Here's a well-discussed example: [BCP all tables into files from a database](http://blogs.lessthandot.com/index.php/datamgmt/dbprogramming/bcp-all-tables-into-files/) from [Less Than Dot](http://blogs.lessthandot.com/).
