title: Finding a Windows Mobile 2003 Emulator Image and Compatible Device Emulator
---

I need to figure out how to emulate Wndows Mobile 2003 as an emulation of our warehouse dolphins. I need to be able to run their version of Internet Explorer without having to ship one of the Dolphins to me.

camTheatre already has a "smartphone" version of device emulation installed, but it only has images for Windows Mobile 6. And, I'm struggling to find a definitive resource on microsoft.com to download an emulator and Windows Mobile 2004 emulator images and a compatible emulator.

However, I need to walk away from this endeavor right now. Here's what I have so far...
