title: "Looking for a Small, Portable FTP Server for Windows"

Looked briefly for a very simple and portable ftp server that can run on Windows without installation, ad-hoc and temporarily from a directory to share that directory's content.

The Swiss File Knife looks like a good option right now. It has even been updated this month (some component anyway, but not necessarily the ftp server), which is years newer than most of the other solutions. After all, who's really writing new FTP software these days?
