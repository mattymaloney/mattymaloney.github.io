[Roots: Enlightened Static Sites](http://roots.cx/)

I'm finally trying roots.cx tonight. I like it. I like the additional flexibility over harp.js, which, like Jade, is saddled by it's self-imposed limitations.

Roots works "out of the box", but also allows me to change the templating language. I added support for slm to my roots installation (technically, I added it to the accord installation which roots depends on), and it works smoothly.

### Templates

This shows several templates that can be used for initializing new roots apps.

[roots-dev/base: base template for roots v3](https://github.com/roots-dev/base)

This is `roots-base`, the default template that's used by the default roots v3 installation when initializing a new app.
