I'm finally trying roots.cx tonight. I like it. I like the additional flexibility over harp.js, which, like Jade, is saddled by it's self-imposed limitations.

Roots works "out of the box", but also allows me to change the templating language. I added support for slm to my roots installation (technically, I added it to the accord installation which roots depends on), and it works smoothly.
