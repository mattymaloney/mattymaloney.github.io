The first useful resources I noticed here:

For Route53, for which I've wanted to make backups before changes, there are a couple options:
* [GitHub - barnybug/cli53: Command line tool for Amazon Route 53](https://github.com/barnybug/cli53)
* [GitHub - winebarrel/roadworker: Roadworker is a tool to manage Route53. It defines the state of Route53 using DSL, and updates Route53 according to DSL.](https://github.com/winebarrel/roadworker)
* [Roadworker - The Best Way to Manage Your Amazon Route53 Records Â· takus's blog](http://blog.takus.me/2013/11/10/roadworker/)

For EC2, this is an interesting multi-terminal webapp.
* [GitHub - skavanagh/EC2Box: A web-based SSH console to execute commands and manage multiple EC2 instances simultaneously running on Amazon Web Services (AWS).](https://github.com/skavanagh/EC2Box)
