[Pliers - A buildy, watchy type tool](http://pliers.js.org/)

When I moved away from Grunt and Gulp a while back, I did so because they were frustrating to configure. Instead, I went with `npm run` as my tool for creating and running tasks and watchers. I've been mostly happy with it, but I'm happy to see [Pliers - A buildy, watchy type tool](http://pliers.js.org/), which appears to take all this one step further. Will look at this more later.
