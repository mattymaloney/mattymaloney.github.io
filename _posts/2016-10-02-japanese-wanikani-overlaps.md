Here are some overlapping wanikani words that are giving me trouble, especially when I try to review using kaniwani. I'm listing the words along with my preferred translation/keyword, in an effort to have a unique value for each. FOr some, I'm also listing the wanikani translation (in parenthesis) for reference.

## So many ways to say "girl", "woman", "female"

I'm only in lesson 3 of wanikani, and already I'm seeing more words for woman/girl/female then I ever realized existed. So far:

* おんな、女 - female
* おんなのひと、女の人 - woman
* おんなのこ、女の子 - young woman (young lady, young woman, young girl, girl)
* じょし、女子 - girl
* しょうじょ、少女 - young lady


## Two "very" words

* なかなか、中々 - considerably (very, considerably, quite)
* おおいに、大いに - a lot of (very, much, greatly, a lot of, very much)

Based on these translations, it looks like 大いに is a little more "very” than 中々.


## Round/Circular

* まる、丸 - round, circle
* まるい、丸い - spherical  
* まるい、円い - circular (round, circular)


## Two "Important" Words

* たいせつ、大切 - 
* たいした、大した - considerable, great, important, big deal
