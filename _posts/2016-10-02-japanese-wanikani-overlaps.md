Here are some overlapping wanikani words that are giving me trouble, especially when I try to review using kaniwani. I'm listing the words along with my preferred translation/keyword, in an effort to have a unique value for each.

## So many ways to say "girl", "woman", "female"

I'm only in lesson 3 of wanikani, and already I'm seeing more words for woman/girl/female then I ever realized existed. So far:

* おんな、女 - female
* おんなのひと、女の人 - woman
* おんなのこ、女の子 - young woman
* じょし、女子 - girl
* しょうじょ、少女 - young lady
* 

## Two "very" words

* なかなか、中々 - very, considerably, quite
* おおいに、大いに -
