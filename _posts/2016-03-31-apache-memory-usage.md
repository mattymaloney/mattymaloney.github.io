title: "Determining Apache (Average) Per-Process Memory Usage"
---



```
ps -ylC httpd --sort:rss | awk '{sum+=$8; ++n} END {print "Tot="sum"("n")";print "Avg="sum"/"n"="sum/n/1024"MB"}'
```

but this has the problem of counting 1 more process than actually exists, and it counts the root process as well -- I'm really looking for the size (or average size) or child processes. The parent process needs to be examined separately.

... or simply `ps -ylC httpd` for a glance.
