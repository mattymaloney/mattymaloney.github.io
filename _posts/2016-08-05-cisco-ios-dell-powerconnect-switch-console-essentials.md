## Cable selection

Here's some technical detail about the cables and pin-outs for Dell switches and routers. I think all the pin-out information applies equally well to Cisco devices as well.

* [What type of console cables are used for Dell PowerConnect, N Series, and Force10 switches | Dell US](http://www.dell.com/Support/Article/us/en/19/QNA43618)

I think this is the cable I'd be using if our switches had RJ-45 console ports.

These 2 cables together is what I'm using to connect from a USB port to a male serial console port on a Dell PowerConnect 5424:

This is the cable I'd be using if I had a PC with an actual serial port (or a USB->serial port) and a switch or router with an RJ-45 console port. I think this is essentially the same skyblue cable that comes with switches:
