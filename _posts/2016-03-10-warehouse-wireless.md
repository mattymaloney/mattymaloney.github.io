title: Warehouse Wireless Infrastructure Brainstorm and Idea Gathering
---

Just beginning the search for fixes and/or a replacement for our warehouse wireless infrastructure.

I like this article. [9 Common Warehouse Wifi Problems and What You Can Do to Fix Them](http://www.securedgenetworks.com/blog/9-Common-Warehouse-Wifi-Problems-and-What-You-Can-Do-to-Fix-Them).

I'm also looking at the Peplink access points which can be added on to our Peplink Balance 380.

* [AP One Model Comparison > Peplink](http://www.peplink.com/products/enterprise-access-point/feature-comparison/)
* [Pepwave AP One 300M (2.4GHz or 5.0GHz) : 3Gstore.com](http://3gstore.com/product/3950_pepwave-ap-one-300m.html)
* [Pepwave AP One Enterprise (3X3 Mimo 11ac, 2.4GHz & 5.0GHz) : 3Gstore.com](http://3gstore.com/product/6250_pepwave-ap-one-enterprise.html)

Peplink also has a new model that may replace the AP One 300M. The AP One Rugged. Will be released in April 2016 maybe.
