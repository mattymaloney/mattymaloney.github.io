title: "Slm, better than Jade?"
---


I'd been searching for an evolution of Jade, beyond Jade and its self-imposed limitations, especially around the control of output whitespace.

I came across slm today. Not sure why I haven't noticed it before.

### On github

[slm-lang/slm: Slim, Jade like template engine for node](https://github.com/slm-lang/slm)


### On npm

[slm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slm)


### Sublime Text Package

[slm-lang/sublime-slm](https://github.com/slm-lang/sublime-slm)
(only on github, not in Package Control)

Why I like Slm:

- It's completely done in JavaScript -- no dependency on ruby or external libraries.
- It offers better control of white-space around inline tags.
- So far, it matches all functionality in Jade that I can find -- I'm not struggling from Jade-withdrawal. Admittedly, I haven't done a point-by-point comparison.
- It contains all the functionality of Slim that I ever considered using. Admittedly, I never actually tried very hard to use Slim.

What's missing:

- Tag interpolation

I did just come across a Jade feature that I miss in Slm -- in-context creation of additional tags. e.g. `span.t1 click #[a(href="go/here") this] link` which, in Jade, produces `<span class="t1">click <a href="go/here">this</a> link</span>`.

Slm requires this syntax, so far as I can tell right now:

```
span.t1
  | click 
  a>(href="go/here") this
  | link
```
