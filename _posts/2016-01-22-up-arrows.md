## Unicode Up Arrows

I'm dissatisfied with what appears to be the standard character being used after a footnote, to denote a link back to the referencing text. The character I've been seeing is ↩ (0x21A9), but it's too similar to the standard "undo" symbol, and it doesn't point up, which should be the natural direction to point, when pointing from a footnote to its referencing text.

Here are the up-pointing arrows that I see in unicode. I'm sure there are more:

    ↩ 0x21A9
    ↟ 0x219F
    ↥ 0x21A5
    ⇧ 0x21E7
    ⇫ 0x21EB
    ⇮ 0x21EE
    ⌃ 0x2303
    ⍐ 0x2350
    ⤊ 0x290A
    ⤒ 0x2912
    ⤴ 0x2934
    ⤻ 0x293B
    ⤾ 0x293E
    ⬆ 0x2B06
    ￪ 0xFFEA

My favorite for this purpose, at least at first impression: ⤴ (0x2934).

0x290A, 0x2912, 0x293B, 0x293E all fail to render on my phone, which has stock android 5 fonts. Before choosing one of these characters, I should find out how well each of them are represented in fonts across various devices.

At second look, from my phone this time, ⇧ (0x21E7) is my favorite. Very easy to see, and very understandable for this purpose. I like that, unlike ⤴, ⇧ has no left-right component or implication. Instead, ⇧ is obvious, without being imposing, and inarguably points to something above.
