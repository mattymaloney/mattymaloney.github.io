title: Help for Managing Teams and Projects with Basecamp
---


Take a look at [Basecamp 3: Manage projects, groups, and client work](https://basecamp.com/) for team and project management.

I like their idea of the 6 tools that are required for team and project management, and they should all be included in the same product. I'm pasting them here for reference, and because I like them.

* **Message boards and comment threads.** Basecamp’s threads keep discussions on-topic and in-context so the whole story stays together in a way that’s easy to follow and reference for the record later. You can comment directly on anything in Basecamp. Comments are designed in a way that people can respond over time as their busy schedules permit.
* **Real-time chat/pings.** Basecamp’s real-time Campfire chats and Pings let you hash something out quickly, show work and get fast feedback, or just ask a question out loud when you don’t know who to ask.
* **Automatic check-ins.** Basecamp’s automatic check-ins surface what’s on people’s minds, what they’ve been working on, and what they plan on doing next. And it happens automatically on a recurring daily/weekly schedule so you don’t have to personally nag anyone for answers.
* **To-do lists.** Basecamp’s to-do lists let you organize and divvy up work to be done. To-do lists let you break down big chunks of work into easily digestable small lists that are simpler to attack, track, and complete.
* **Docs & file storage.** Basecamp’s docs & files section lets you visually organize PDFs, Google Docs, images, or other files into folders so everyone on your team can find what they need on their own without having to ask anyone.
* **A centralized schedule.** Basecamp’s schedule keeps track of all major milestones, deadlines, upcoming events, and to-dos with due dates. Dates are clearly posted so everyone can find out what’s due when. You can add Basecamp’s schedule to your Google, iCal, or Outlook calendar.

The pricing ([Basecamp 3 Prices](https://basecamp.com/3/pricing)) indicates that basecamp costs $29/month for unlimited users and 100GB of storage space. However, the first "basecamp" we create is freee. I'm not sure what that means and if we even need more than one basecamp.
