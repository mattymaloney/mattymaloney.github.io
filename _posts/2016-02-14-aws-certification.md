title: AWS Certification for Learning
---

I guess I wasn't paying attention, because I just now noticed that AWS offers certification options.

[AWS Certification - AWS Cloud Computing Certification Program](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/)

AAt this age and point in my career, I'm not actually interested in obtaining any new certifications. My interest is that certification paths are very useful to learn aspects of a technology that are currently beyond your needs.

As we've grown into using AWS, we learn just enough to use the features that we need. We don't know much about all the other possibilities, all the myriad ways the solution we have could have been architected.

I may wander down this certification path to learn more about deployment, migration, failover options, and more.
