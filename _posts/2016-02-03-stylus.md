### [Why I Choose Stylus (And You Should Too)](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/why-i-choose-stylus-and-you-should-too--webdesign-18412)

A good rundown of less, sass, and stylus.


### [Axis](http://axis.netlify.com/)

A Stylus plugin and more.


### [nib - CSS3 extensions for Stylus](https://tj.github.io/nib/)

[tj/nib: Stylus mixins, utilities, components, and gradient image generation](https://github.com/tj/nib)

Nib is older now, and Axis is probably a better alternative.
