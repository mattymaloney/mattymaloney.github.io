## しか vs だけ

しか and だけ have nearly/basically the same meaning, but are used in different grammatical situations. I think I used to understand the differences, but can't remember at all right now.


## 丸 vs 円

丸 and 円 have the nearly the same meaning, which is round or circular in the 2-dimensional sense. I've never known or understood when to use one over the other. On signs, and in basic reading opportunities that I find, I see 丸 being used to mean round or circular, and I only see 円 being used to refer to yen. I'm not sure which, but I believe one of these kanji can also be used to mean sphere, as well as 2-dimensional round things.
