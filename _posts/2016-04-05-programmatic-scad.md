title: Programmatic CAD and Programmatic SCAD
---

I started using [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) a while back. I'm quite impressed with it, but also came across some quirks and limitations that made me want to step back and look at the field of "Programmatic CAD" applications, as they're apparently classified. I'm pleasantly surprised at the large amount of work that has been done in this field.

[OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/)

The first one I noticed, and the first one I used.

[ImplicitCad.org](http://www.implicitcad.org/)

This looks like another mature project. The in-browser version (ImplicitCAD Cloud) doesn't seem to work, at least not in Firefox v44.0.2 on Fedora 23 -- possibly due to a missing/broken WebGL. I'm hoping for better results with a download.

[Programmatic CAD, OpenSCAD alternatives | Emacs Tragic](https://emacstragic.net/programmatic-cad-openscad-alternatives/)

Someone's attempt at a list of open source programmable cad applications. Definitely some new resources here, and worth a closer look.
