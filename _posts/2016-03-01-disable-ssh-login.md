title: Disable SSH Login for Root and Other Users
---



To disable direct ssh logins for a user, especially root, here's a basic run-down.

Also, since this action can disable the root user's ssh access, you'll need to use `sudo` to become root. This post cleared up some of my own confusion about the differences between alternative ways to become root via `sudo`. It expecially cleared up for me which password is expected for each type of invocation for `sudo` or `su` and what the new shell environment will contain.

To better understand which users on the box are allowed to connect via ssh, try [linux - List of all users that can connect via SSH - Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15802179/list-of-all-users-that-can-connect-via-ssh). This question was answered, sort of, almost, but it really wasn't answered sufficiently. 

More/better insights here (at least for debian): [linux - Which users are allowed to log in via SSH by default? - Unix & Linux Stack Exchange](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/36804/which-users-are-allowed-to-log-in-via-ssh-by-default). I think the centos configuration is much the same.

The /etc/shadow file has been confusing to me in the past. I understand it better now, after reading [Understanding /etc/shadow file](http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/understanding-etcshadow-file/).
