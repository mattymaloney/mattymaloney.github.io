title: "Apache mod_dbd - Useful for Managing PHP's DB/MSSQL/MySQL Connections?"

Something I never heard of: [mod_dbd - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_dbd.html) for pooling database connections, which I think can be shared with php. Will this be more efficient than letting php manage the connections?
