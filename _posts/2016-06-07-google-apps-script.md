This is something I would have liked to know about: [Apps Script â€“ Google Apps Script](https://www.google.com/script/start/)

I think this is what I'll need to enforce our google apps users to change their passwords every X days.

Although, apparently Postini already supported password policies? See: [Set User Password Policies](https://www.google.com/support/enterprise/static/postini/docs/admin/en/admin_ee_cu/user_password_policies.html). However, that functionality doesn't seem to have transitioned to Google Apps since disolving Postini. See: [Postini Transition Resource Center](http://postini-transition.googleapps.com/).
