I've mostly chosen [prose.io](http://prose.io/) for jekyll content editing, falling back on github.com itself when necessary. Prose is really quite wonderful, but lacks several features that seem obvious to me. I hope to get around to hosting my own forked prose.io, so that I can implement these features, most of which are very simple. Hope, phase 2, I'll pull-request those features to the real prose.io. Unfortunately, the real prose.io doesn't really appear to maintained much.

Prose.io on github: [prose/prose - JavaScript](https://github.com/prose/prose)
